//Project: Simple Library Management System
//The goal of this project is to create a Simple Library Management System that
//allows users to manage a collection of books by adding,
//removing, and listing them. You will be working with Kotlin concepts
//like variables, data types, arrays, array methods, strings,
//string methods, functions, and classes.
